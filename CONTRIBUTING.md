# Contributing

I've loved crafting this template as an OSS template. Get started today and for assistance, you can reach on [X](https://x.com/praveentcom). You can also shoot PRs on the way if you'd like something added to DevMDX or if there is a bug that's bothering you.

## Getting started

- Fork and clone the repo
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Run dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Run lint: `pnpm lint`
- Run build: `pnpm build`

## Commit messages

- Use clear, descriptive messages. Conventional Commits are appreciated but not required.
