# ✨ DevMDX: MDX-powered blog template

DevMDX is a simple, lightweight blog template built with Next.js and MDX. It renders MDX files as blog posts with a focus on performance and SEO, with built-in support for sitemap and RSS feed.

## Backstory

While I have used multiple blog platforms to host my articles in the past, it always made sense to build one which I can maintain to my taste and own the content.

With experience in building apps with Next.js and MDX, I crafted my perfect website that contains a space to host my articles, projects and work experiences. This later turned out to be something that could be shared with the wider developer community.

Although it's not comprehensive enough to be considered as a perfect portfolio template, it's a good starting point for someone who loves to write markdown and host their articles on their own website and infrastructure.

## How to use?

### Setting up

I'd recommend forking this repository or use the "Use this template" button in GitHub to copy the template to your GitHub account. Once done and cloned, you should be able to get this template running as-is without any additional efforts with the following bootstrap commands.

```
npm install
npm run
```

### Theming

I've used shadcn/ui for setting up the template. This means you can adapt DevMDX to your taste with custom shadcn/ui theming. Refer to [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) for more details on how to modify.

### Modifying sections

This is an opinionated template. It means, I have curated it to be useful for someone who writes articles, publishes projects and contribute to the community with talks. It might not make sense for you to use all these three sections. Feel free to tweak them as you need.

DevMDX contains the support for publishing the following contents. All these pages can be modified directly on the template to suit your needs.

- Blog Articles (`/articles`)
- Projects (`/projects`)
- Community Contributions (`/community`)
- Work History (`/work`)
- Education History (`/education`)
- Cover Letter (`/cover`)
- About (`/about`)

The content for these pages (`markdown` format) live in a common `data` folder in the root of the template which you can modify with ease. The template already contains sample content which can be modified easily.

## Final notes

I've loved crafting this template as an OSS template. Get started today and for assistance, you can reach on [X](https://x.com/praveentcom). You can also shoot PRs on the way if you'd like something added to DevMDX or if there is a bug that's bothering you.
