## Overview

Building the next generation of developer tools at Acme Technologies. I lead frontend architecture decisions and work closely with product to ship features that developers actually want to use.

## Key Achievements

- Rebuilt the main dashboard from scratch, improving load times by 60%
- Introduced TypeScript across the frontend codebase
- Set up CI/CD pipelines that cut deployment time in half
- Mentored two junior engineers through their first major features

## Tech Stack

The product is a React-based SPA with a Node.js backend. We use PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching, and deploy everything on AWS using ECS and CloudFront.
