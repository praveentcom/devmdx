Hi there,

Thanks for taking the time to check out my profile. I'm a software engineer who genuinely enjoys the craft of building things that work well and look good.

My days are spent jumping between frontend and backend, trying to make apps faster, and automating away the boring stuff. I've picked up a few battle scars from scaling systems and debugging production issues at 2 AM.

I document my learnings through [blog posts](/articles) and share code through [open source projects](/projects). Outside of work, I enjoy speaking at local [tech meetups](/community) and helping others level up.

Cheers,
John
