👋 Welcome to the DevMDX demo! This is a sample blog portfolio showcasing what you can build with DevMDX.

Turning caffeine into code since 2015. I build web apps, dabble in mobile, and occasionally write about the things I learn along the way. Find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/johndoe), read my thoughts on [X](https://x.com/johndoe), or browse my [projects](/projects) and [articles](/articles).

You can customise this template to your own needs by modifying the `data` folder. For instance, this section of the homepage is rendered from the `markdown` file located at `data/profile/intro.md`. You can replace this content with your own and add more sections as you need.
