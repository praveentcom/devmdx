Hey, welcome to my corner of the internet.

I spend most of my time writing code, breaking things, and occasionally fixing them. Currently shipping features at a fast-growing startup where I get to work on everything from database schemas to pixel-perfect UIs.

When I'm not staring at a terminal, you'll find me tinkering with [side projects](/projects), writing about things I've learned the hard way in my [articles](/articles), or rambling at [meetups](/community) about why everyone should care about web performance.

Check out my [work history](/work) if you're curious about the journey so far. Feel free to drop me a line on [X](https://x.com/johndoe) or shoot an email to [hello@example.com](mailto:hello@example.com).
