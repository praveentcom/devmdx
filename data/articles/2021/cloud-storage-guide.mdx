## The Problem

You've got data to store—backups, archives, assets. Local drives fail. Free cloud tiers run out. Enterprise solutions cost a fortune. What do you do?

## Storage Tiers Explained

Most cloud providers offer tiered storage:

| Tier       | Cost | Access Time   | Best For          |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Standard   | $$$  | Instant       | Active data       |
| Infrequent | $$   | Seconds       | Backups           |
| Archive    | $    | Minutes-hours | Long-term storage |

## My Recommendation

For most developers, a mix of Standard (for active projects) and Archive (for everything else) hits the sweet spot. You'll save 70-80% compared to storing everything in Standard.

## Getting Started

1. Audit what you're storing
2. Move anything older than 90 days to Infrequent
3. Archive anything you rarely access
4. Set up lifecycle policies to automate this
