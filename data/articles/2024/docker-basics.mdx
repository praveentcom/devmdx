## My Resistance

"It works on my machine" was fine until it wasn't. Spent too many hours debugging environment issues.

## The Aha Moment

Docker isn't about containers or VMs. It's about reproducibility. Same environment everywhere—your laptop, CI, production.

## Getting Started

A simple Dockerfile for a Node.js app:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## What Changed

- New developers onboard in minutes, not hours
- "Works on my machine" is now actually useful
- Deployments are boring (in a good way)

## My Advice

Start simple. Containerize one project. Feel the pain points disappear. Then expand.
