## The Goal

Build APIs that are intuitive, consistent, and a joy to work with.

## Naming Matters

- Use nouns for resources: `/users`, `/orders`
- Use verbs for actions: `/users/123/activate`
- Be consistent with pluralization

## Status Codes

Use them correctly:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad request (your fault)
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not found
- `500` - Server error (our fault)

## Error Responses

Always include:

```json
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "message": "Email is required",
  "field": "email"
}
```

## Versioning

Prefix your routes: `/v1/users`. When v2 comes, old clients keep working.
