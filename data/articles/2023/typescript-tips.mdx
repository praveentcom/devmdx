## Why TypeScript

After years of JavaScript, TypeScript changed how I write code. Here are five patterns I reach for constantly.

## 1. Discriminated Unions

Perfect for handling different states:

```typescript
type Result<T> = 
  | { status: 'success'; data: T }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string };
```

## 2. Type Guards

Narrow types safely at runtime:

```typescript
function isUser(obj: unknown): obj is User {
  return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && 'id' in obj;
}
```

## 3. Utility Types

`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit` save so much boilerplate. Learn them once, use them forever.

## 4. Const Assertions

Lock down literal types with `as const`. Great for config objects and action types.
