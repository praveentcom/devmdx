## The Problem

My app felt sluggish. Clicks had noticeable delays. Time to investigate.

## What I Found

1. **Too many re-renders** - Components updating when they didn't need to
2. **Heavy computations** - Calculations running on every render
3. **Large bundles** - Shipping too much JavaScript

## The Fixes

### Use React.memo wisely

Wrap components that receive the same props frequently. Don't wrap everything—profile first.

### useMemo for expensive calculations

```typescript
const sorted = useMemo(
  () => items.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name)),
  [items],
);
```

### Code splitting

Lazy load routes and heavy components. Users don't need everything upfront.

## Results

Load time dropped 40%. Interactions feel instant. Users are happier.
