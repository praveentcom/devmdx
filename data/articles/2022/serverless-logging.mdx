## Why Logging Matters

Serverless is great until something breaks at 2 AM and you have no idea why. Proper logging is your best friend for debugging production issues.

## The Approach

Create a simple logging wrapper that works across your serverless functions:

```typescript
class Logger {
  async log(level: string, message: string, data?: object) {
    const entry = {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      level,
      message,
      ...data
    };
    
    // Send to your logging service
    await this.sendToCloudLogging(entry);
  }
}
```

## Key Tips

1. **Always await logs** - Serverless functions terminate fast
2. **Include context** - Request ID, user ID, function name
3. **Use structured logging** - JSON is easier to query than text
4. **Set up alerts** - Get notified when errors spike

## What I Use

A combination of structured JSON logs sent to a cloud logging service with alerts configured for error spikes. Simple but effective.
