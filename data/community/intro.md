I believe in giving back to the community that helped me grow. Over the years, I've had the chance to speak at local meetups, mentor junior developers, and contribute to open source projects.

There's something special about sharing what you know and learning from others in the process. If you're organizing an event and think I could add value, feel free to reach out.
