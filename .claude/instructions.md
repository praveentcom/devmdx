# DevMDX Project Rules

## File Modification Rules

### .gitignore
- **DO NOT** modify the `.gitignore` file unless explicitly requested by the user
- The `.gitignore` file is managed by the project maintainers
- If you need to ignore files, ask the user first before making changes

### Data Directory
- The `/data` directory contains user-generated content created by `npm run init`
- This directory should NOT be committed to version control
- It is intentionally left untracked for users to customize their own content

## General Guidelines
- Always ask before modifying configuration files
- Respect existing project structure and conventions
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the codebase
